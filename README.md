# Unsupported BeardedSpice Strategies

Since adding new strategies or updating already existing strategies in the _BeardedSpice release_ requires a comprehensive check (which sometimes cannot be performed due to technical reasons, for example, requiring a paid account or the site being in a different language), we cannot add support fully to all websites.

For this reason, it was decided to create this section, which is filled with files in a form that can be easily imported into BeardedSpice.

These files were provided by contributors and placed without a full check of their functionality. Therefore, **use these strategies at your own risk**.

## Usage

This folder contains unsupported strategies in the form of `bsstrategy` files. Download the desirable file, or download _zip_ file from latest [release](https://github.com/beardedspice/BS-Strategies/releases), or the entire repository (using the green _"Clone or download"_ button), and then import what you want into BeardedSpice.

Files of type `bsstrategy` can be imported to BeadredSpice by double clicking on them, or via the _"Import..."_ button in the _"Preferences..."_ pane.

## To Contribute

You can easily add a BeardedSpice strategy to this repository using standard pull-request practice. The file will be merged with minimal checks: no duplicates, a suitable name, and an increase in version number.

A `bsstrategy` file is a plain text file that contains `javascript` code describing a BeardedSpice strategy for a particular site.

You can export the strategies used in the BeardedSpice app and use them as a template for changes or for creating a brand new strategy: (_"Preferences..."_ -> _"Media Controllers:"_ -> _"Export..."_).

Also the **[Developer How-To Guide](https://github.com/beardedspice/beardedspice/blob/master/docs/developers-guide-web.md)** has information on how to create (or update) a strategy, mainly in the **[Writing a Media Strategy](https://github.com/beardedspice/beardedspice/blob/master/docs/developers-guide-web.md#writing-a-media-strategy)**  section.
